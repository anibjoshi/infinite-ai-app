While you may be waiting until Prime Day to score a sweet deal on an Apple iPad, you may want to take advantage of this early Amazon sale to buy one now.

Amazon is having a secret sale on the Apple iPad (9th Gen), dropping the price to $279, instead of $329, for 15% off savings.

Plus, there’s a $29 coupon that applies at checkout that takes the price of the tablet down to $250 — the lowest price it has ever sold for on Amazon.

The Apple iPad deal is an early surprise from Amazon that comes just ahead of its massive Prime Day sale that runs from July 11-12.

Those who are in the market for a new iPad, we recommend taking advantage of this secret sale now. Even though Prime Day is next week, there’s no guarantee the extra coupon at checkout will be offered then.

For this deal, the Apple iPad is sold with WiFi and 64GB storage capacity. The device also has a 10.2-inch Retina display, a more powerful A13 Bionic chip, ultra wide front camera and 8MP wide back camera.

It is also compatible with the Apple Pencil, as well as the Apple Smart Keyboard, and comes in silver or space gray.
